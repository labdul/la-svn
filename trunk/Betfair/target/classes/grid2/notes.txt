platform: "WINDOWS", "ANDROID", "XP", "VISTA", "MAC", "LINUX"
browserName: "chrome", "firefox", "opera", "ie", "htmlunit", "iphone", "safari"
version: "ANY"

Example:

		  "platform": "WINDOWS",
          "browserName": "firefox",
		  "version": "19.0",
		  "firefox_binary": "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox d-ala\\firefox.exe",
          "maxInstances": 1,
          "seleniumProtocol": "WebDriver"
          
firefox_binary is used only if you have installed different versions of firefox on the same machine

For chrome, we should use chromedriver and start the nodes with -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver,
where chromedriver is the path including the executable

Safari tests are not supported by the grid

For android tests:

http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/AndroidDriver

It needs to be run as a hub on the same machine where the tests are being run as the android emulator 
assign a strange ip and the server can be accessed only from http://localhost


For ios tests:

http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/IPhoneDriver

It needs to be run as a hub o a different machine also as the iphone / ipad simulator is generating 
dhcp ip address
